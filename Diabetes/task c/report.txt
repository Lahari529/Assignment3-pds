Bootstrap prediction for BloodPressure

We used 500 bootstrap samples (each with 150 people) to estimate three important BloodPressure statistics: the average (mean), standard deviation, and 98th percentile.

The average of the bootstrap means was very close to the actual population mean, showing that bootstrapping does a good job of capturing the overall average.

The same was true for the standard deviation and the 98th percentile â€” the bootstrap results were very similar to the true population values.

The histograms of the bootstrap results for each statistic showed that most of the values were grouped around the population values, with only a small amount of variation.
